# Sensor Fault Detection for Wafer Manufacturing

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based sensor fault detection system for wafer manufacturing processes. The system utilizes data collected from various sensors during the wafer production process and applies machine learning techniques to identify faulty sensors or anomalous readings. Detecting sensor faults in real-time is crucial in wafer manufacturing to ensure product quality, reduce downtime, and improve overall process efficiency.

## Features

- **Sensor Data Monitoring**: Real-time data collection from multiple sensors (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity, vibration) used during the wafer manufacturing process.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning models designed to detect anomalies and sensor faults, ensuring the reliability of sensor readings.
- **Fault Diagnosis**: Classifying and diagnosing sensor faults to assist in decision-making regarding maintenance and process adjustments.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Predicting potential sensor failures before they occur, minimizing production downtime.
- **Visualization**: Visual tools for analyzing sensor performance and faults over time.
- **Alert System**: Real-time alerts or notifications for detected sensor failures or anomalies.
